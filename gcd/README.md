#### Project description 

This project can read from the command line 2 numbers and fine the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) between the two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
If either of the numbers is 0 or there is a false input of numbers the program will end with an exit code of 1 else it will have an exit code of 0.  

#### Usage 

To use the project compile it with the following command: gcc -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -o gcd gcd.c

Then you can enter the numbers you what to find the GCD with the command:  ./gcd num0 num1
